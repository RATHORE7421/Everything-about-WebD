1)const:
define constant values that can not changed once a value is set. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared. 
The scope of const is block-scoped it means it can not be accessed from outside of block.

2)let:
 you should always declare variables with const, if you realize that the value of the variable needs to change, go back and change it to let. 
 Use let when you know that the value of a variable will change. Use const for every other variable.
